Change the loop in the [phunks script](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/cryptopunks/blob/master/phunks/phunks.rb) from:

```
punks.each do |punk|
  phunks << punk.mirror    #ยน 
end
```

to save the phunks one-by-one in 24x24 and in 192x192 (with 8x zoom) try:

```
punks.each_with_index do |punk,i| phunk = punk.mirror
  phunk.save( "phunk-#{i}.png" ) 
  phunk.zoom(8).save( "phunk-#{i}@8x.png" )
  phunks << phunk ## add to composite
end 
```

(Re)run the script and voila - you will get 20 000 phunk images in two series in the 24x24 and 192x192 (with 8x zoom) format e.g. `phunk-0.png`, `phunk-0@8x.png`, `phunk-1.png`, `phunk-1@8x.png`, and so on.
