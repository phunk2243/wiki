## What is NotLarvaLabs?

NotLarvaLabs (NLL) is a community built royalty-free Marketplace for buying and selling CryptoPhunks, built on top of it's own custom [**smart contract**](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd6c037bE7FA60587e174db7A6710f7635d2971e7#code) with 0% fees.\
NLL developers decided to [**open-source**](https://github.com/Crypto-Phunks/CryptoPhunksMarket) the code and renounce the [**ownership**](https://twitter.com/NotLarvaLabs/status/1503576060448985089?s=20\&t=Tbap3ogy88gjcQXn\_DGRYQ), this means that Phunks Marketplace (backend) operates autonomously on Ethereum blockchain forever.\
Code has been [**audited**](https://github.com/Crypto-Phunks/CryptoPhunksMarket/blob/main/zMarketplaceAudit.pdf) by several developers, [**documented**](https://github.com/Crypto-Phunks/CryptoPhunksMarket/blob/main/zMarketplaceAudit.pdf) by Solidity developer [**@t\_snark**](https://twitter.com/t\_snark).
