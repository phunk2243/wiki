# CRYPTOPHUNKS

## Phunk is Punk

CryptoPhunks (Phunks) is a [Non-Fungible Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible\_token) (NFT) collection on the [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). The project was created in June 2021 by a group of anonymous developers. \
In July 2021, after receiving [DMCA](https://twitter.com/CryptoPhunks/status/1415001685986922499?s=20\&t=YRRn6i6uXhGV5Cgl\_pJeQA) served by [LarvaLabs](https://larvalabs.com) for copyright infringement, biggest NFT trading platform [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/assets/0xf07468ead8cf26c752c676e43c814fee9c8cf402/8348) censored and banned the collection from their platform for the third and final time. Shortly after, original developers compiled [Open Letter](https://foundation.app/@cryptophunks/foundation/62017) to LarvaLabs and left the project since.\
In a Spirit of web3 culture a renegade group of community builders took it upon themselves to create their own Phunk marketplace called [NotLarvaLabs](broken-reference) and [open-source](open-sourced.md) the code.

CryptoPhunks are the same as CryptoPunks just flipped the other way.

## Phunk is web3

Only after original developers left the project, perfect conditions emerged for phunks to grow into a biggest web3 movement in history of crypto. \
Today phunks stand for decentralisation, censorship resistance, for the people and freedom. \
Phunks are important part of NFT history that raised so many important questions around ownership, copyright, conceptual art, [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en), blockchain provenance, [open source](open-sourced.md), touching subjects like; What is Art? Who decides what Art is? Do you really own your NFT?\
Phunks are challenging the status quo, they challenge power structures, symbolise anti-establishment, counter-culture and are know for their rebel Spirit. :fist:\
Phunks phenomena is also known as [#Phunkism](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Phunkism\&src=typed\_query\&f=live) , it quickly became inspiration for many future projects ([#Ph](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ph?src=hashtag\_click) [#0x](https://twitter.com/hashtag/0x?src=hashtag\_click) [#v1](https://twitter.com/hashtag/v1?src=hashtag\_click) [#v2](https://twitter.com/hashtag/v2?src=hashtag\_click) [#v3](https://twitter.com/hashtag/v3?src=hashtag\_click)). It made people think about [web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) value proposition, constantly pushing the boundaries, taking whole NFT ecosystem to move in right direction of decentralisation, ownership and censorship resistance. \
Phunks were also used as a great case study and a reference on several [academic papers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4029323) around web3, IP and copyrights in this new emerging crypto evolution.&#x20;
