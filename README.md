# CRYPTOPHUNKS

## Phunk is Punk

CryptoPhunks (Phunks) is a [Non-Fungible Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible\_token) (NFT) collection on the [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). \
The project was created in June 2021 by a group of [anonymous](https://twitter.com/CryptoPhunks) developers to poke fun (parody) at the high-brow, pompous group of people that were reflecting the “old-school” rules of art into this new frontier of [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) and NFTs. What they did is they took all 10'000 [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) and flipped them the other way, they are the same 1:1 just facing Left.

In July 2021, after receiving formal [DMCA](https://twitter.com/CryptoPhunks/status/1415001685986922499?s=20\&t=YRRn6i6uXhGV5Cgl\_pJeQA) served by [LarvaLabs](https://larvalabs.com) for copyright infringement, the biggest NFT trading Marketplace [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/assets/0xf07468ead8cf26c752c676e43c814fee9c8cf402/8348) censored and banned the collection from their platform for the third and final time. Shortly after, the original developers compiled an [Open Letter](https://foundation.app/@cryptophunks/foundation/62017) to LarvaLabs and left the project since.&#x20;

Being censored and cut out from [98%](https://coinyuppie.com/why-is-opensea-an-absolute-monopolist-in-the-nft-trading-market/#:\~:text=In%20summary%2C%20OpenSea%20is%20currently,field%20of%20NFT%20trading%20market.) NFT Market, Phunk holders (1400+) had to experience in real time what it means to be deplatformed by Corporations (Web2) in decentralized environment (Web3) where decentralization and provenance should be paramount and old rules not applied.

It didn't take long before Phunks Community decided to take a stand against censorship, self organised renegade group of Phunk Community builders took it upon themselves to create their own Phunks Marketplace called [NotLarvaLabs](nll/notlarvalabs/notlarvalabs.md) and [open-sourced](resources/open-sourced.md) the code for public good.

CryptoPhunks are the same as <mark style="color:green;"></mark> [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) just flipped the [other way](https://phunks.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/#phunk-is-art).

## Phunk is Web3

Since [Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html) and [Bitcoin](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/1/) introduction to the world, people are able to transact directly without the need of central intermediary or rule-makers using blockchain technology. This technology empowered people to freely express their thoughts and views, in writings and Art, to the world without fear of being censored.&#x20;

CryptoPhunks stand for those principles of decentralization, censorship resistance, [public good](https://cryptonews.com/videos/funding-the-commons-funding-public-goods-algorithms-and-mechanisms.htm), for the people and for the freedom.&#x20;

> Phunks are free-use, public domain Art, run entirely by decentralized community of artist and [builders](resources/open-sourced.md). There are no Devs, no Leaders, no Roadmaps, just Phunk Pham building cool stuff cause they care about Web3 and decentralization. :fist:

Phunks are important part of the NFT history that raised important questions and [discussions](social-media/media/threads.md) around ownership, copyright, conceptual art, [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en), blockchain provenance, touching on subjects like; Who decides what Art is? Do you really own your NFT?

Phunks are challenging the status quo, they challenge power structures, for many phunks symbolise anti-establishment, counter-culture and are know for their rebel Spirit constantly pushing the boundaries, taking whole NFT ecosystem to move in the right direction of decentralization, public good, ownership and censorship resistance. Phunks were big inspiration to many NFT projects that came after and share the same ethos.

If you hold a Phunk you actually own it, without fear that yours Phunks ownership can be resold from one Corporation to another as it happened to [CryptoPunks and Meebits](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1502420714527334406?s=20\&t=J5ZZNygm5AQ4XfL58MAxTw), that's the beauty of Web3; Removing power from Corporations and giving power back to the People.

{% hint style="info" %}
In times when [VCs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapitalist.asp) and [Big Corporations](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22991272/yuga-labs-seed-funding-a16z-bored-ape-yacht-club-bayc-metaverse-other-side) are entering Web3 to claim ownership over your NFTs and extract huge profits, CryptoPhunks are more relevant than ever as a statement against centralization in this emerging Crypto evolution where decentralization and provenance should be paramount. By owning a CryptoPhunk, you will forever [commemorate](https://phunks.medium.com/the-cryptophunks-manifesto-785c7348e558) this ongoing fight against centralization.

## Phunk is Art

{% hint style="info" %}
Phunks are many things to many people, based on all information I gathered following phunks since its inception [I will](https://twitter.com/iape\_) try my best to objectively explain what makes Phunks Art.
{% endhint %}

To understand Artistic value behind Phunks one must understand [Conceptual Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual\_art),[ Marcel Duchamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel\_Duchamp), [Dadaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada).. Phunks Artistic value comes from expression, activity and events not just from the image itself, this is commonly known in art world as a [performance art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance\_art).&#x20;

Here are few examples to better understand Modern Conceptual Art behind Phunks:

| ORIGINAL IMAGE (Crypto Punks)                             | FLIPPED IMAGE (Crypto Phunks)                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Punk is facing Right                                      | Phunk is facing Left                                                    |
| Punk is moving away from you                              | Phunk is moving towards you                                             |
| Punk is owned by [YugaLabs](https://twitter.com/yugalabs) | Phunk is owned by [You](https://notlarvalabs.com/cryptophunks/myphunks) |
| Punk is Centralized                                       | Phunk is Decentralized                                                  |
| Punk is Web2                                              | Phunk is Web3                                                           |
| ERC20                                                     | ERC721                                                                  |

You can see from examples above that such small gesture like flipping an image the other way can give whole new meaning and different perception, making it 100% transformative.&#x20;

> Phunks are conceptual art that actually have context, narrative, critique on the space. \
> There is more artistic merit in phunks than just about any pfp project. [@CsenOner](https://twitter.com/CsenOner/status/1512709948467257345?s=20\&t=W79OmfK5hl4BrLO6Shkcqg)

It's the people that give it meaning, community, events and philosophy behind it. Phunks Artistic value came to life when [LarvaLabs](https://www.larvalabs.com) decided to [deplatform](https://twitter.com/CryptoPhunks/status/1415001685986922499?s=20\&t=YRRn6i6uXhGV5Cgl\_pJeQA) Phunks collection from Biggest NFT Marketplace [OpenSea](https://opensea.io), making a Corporate (Web2) move in decentralized environment (Web3).&#x20;

While NFT Collections can be banned from centralized trading platform, they really cant be censored. Phunks live in form of ERC721 token on the Ethereum blockchain, forever.

After being banned from NFT trading ecosystem, phunks community stood up and made their own marketplace called [**not** Larva Labs](nll/notlarvalabs/) with 0% trading fees. That's was a beautiful performance act, very interesting move that sent a signal all the way to the top that you can't stop people that are passionate about something to build in this new paradigm called Crypto, no matter how anyone feels about it.

Art is in the story, movement, culture, philosophy, interpretation and belief.
