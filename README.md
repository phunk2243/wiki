# CRYPTOPHUNKS

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:green;">Nothing is official with Phunks, everything is contribution. No devs, No roadmaps, No bs, just different projects run by savvy builders. There is Phunks and then there is us</mark> :fist:
{% endhint %}

## Phunk is Punk

CryptoPhunks (Phunks) is a [Non-Fungible Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible\_token) (NFT) ERC721 collection on the [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). The project was created in June 2021 by a group of anonymous developers to poke fun at the high-brow, pompous group of people that were reflecting the “old-school” rules of art into this new frontier of NFTs. \
In July 2021, after receiving [DMCA](https://twitter.com/CryptoPhunks/status/1415001685986922499?s=20\&t=YRRn6i6uXhGV5Cgl\_pJeQA) served by [LarvaLabs](https://larvalabs.com) for copyright infringement, biggest NFT trading platform [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/assets/0xf07468ead8cf26c752c676e43c814fee9c8cf402/8348) censored and banned the collection from their platform for the third and final time. Shortly after, original developers compiled [Open Letter](https://foundation.app/@cryptophunks/foundation/62017) to LarvaLabs and left the project since.\
In a Spirit of web3 culture a renegade group of community builders took it upon themselves to create their own Phunk marketplace called [NotLarvaLabs](NLL/notlarvalabs.md) and [open-source](sources/open-sourced.md) the code.

{% endhint %}

## Phunk is web3

Only after original developers left the project, perfect conditions emerged for phunks to organically grow into a biggest web3 movement in history of crypto, run entirely by decentralized community of artist and builders.\
Phunks stand for decentralisation, censorship resistance, for the people and for the freedom. \
They are important part of NFT history that raised so many important questions and endless discussions around ownership, copyright, conceptual art, [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en), blockchain provenance, touching subjects like; Who decides what Art is? Do you really own your NFT?\
Phunks are challenging the status quo, they challenge power structures, for many they symbolise anti-establishment, counter-culture and are know for their rebel Spirit :fist: constantly pushing the boundaries, taking whole NFT ecosystem to move in right direction of decentralisation, ownership and censorship resistance.\
Phunks were also used as a great case study and a reference on several [academic papers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4029323) around web3, IP and copyrights in this new emerging crypto evolution.&#x20;
