# CRYPTOPHUNKS

## Phunk is Punk

CryptoPhunks (;Phunks) is a [Non-Fungible Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible\_token) (;NFT) collection on the [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). The project was created in June 2021 by a group of anonymous developers. After receiving [DMCA](https://twitter.com/CryptoPhunks/status/1415001685986922499?s=20\&t=YRRn6i6uXhGV5Cgl\_pJeQA) served by [LarvaLabs](https://larvalabs.com) for copyright infringement in July 2021, biggest NFT trading platform [OpenSea](https://opensea.io) censored and banned the collection from their platform for the third and final time. Shortly after, original developers compiled [Open Letter to LarvaLabs](https://foundation.app/@cryptophunks/foundation/62017) and left the project since.\
For the web3 culture :fist: a renegade group of community builders took it upon themselves to create their own Phunk marketplace called [NotLarvaLabs](NLL/notlarvalabs.md).

"By owning a CryptoPhunk, you will forever commemorate this ongoing fight against centralisation." - from [CryptoPhunks Manifesto](https://phunks.medium.com/the-cryptophunks-manifesto-785c7348e558).

&#x20;`⚠️ CryptoPhunks are the same as` [`CryptoPunks`](https://larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) `just flipped the other way.`&#x20;

## Phunk is web3

Only after original developers left the project, perfect conditions emerged to grow phunks into a biggest web3 movement in history of crypto. \
Today phunks stand for decentralisation, censorship resistance, people and freedom. \
Phunks are important part of NFT history and raised important questions around ownership, copyright, [cc0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en), conceptual art, blockchain provenance, [open source](open-sourced.md) , what is Art? who decides what Art is? Phunks are challenging the status quo, they challenge power structures and are know for their rebel Spirit.\
Phunks were also used as a great case study and a reference on several [academic papers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4029323) around web3, NFTs and copyrights. \
Phunks phenomena quickly became inspiration to many projects ([#Ph](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ph?src=hashtag\_click) [#0x](https://twitter.com/hashtag/0x?src=hashtag\_click) [#v1](https://twitter.com/hashtag/v1?src=hashtag\_click) [#v2](https://twitter.com/hashtag/v2?src=hashtag\_click) [#v3](https://twitter.com/hashtag/v3?src=hashtag\_click)) it made people think about [web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) value proposition and stimulates whole NFT ecosystem to move in right direction of decentralisation, ownership and censorship resistance.&#x20;
