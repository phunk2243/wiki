# PHUNKY

$PHUNKY is ERC20 Token that runs on Ethereum blockchain. Each Phunk you hold mines approx 2.7 $PHUNKY a day, everything is handled by a [$PHUNKY](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8ce518fe6cffb769c547e567d7bdc3e59a633fe1) smart contract and no interaction is needed. Tokens are claimable at any time. \
Every time you claim $PHUNKY a portion (10%) goes to [PHUNK DAO](dao.md), unclaimed tokens are easily claimable at [phunkdao.com](https://phunkdao.com) with just few clicks. \
Similar to [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org), token emission halves each year till max supply of 21M $PHUNKY is reached.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
When Phunk is sold or transferred to a different Wallet, any unclaimed $PHUNKY is also transferred to a new owner.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
