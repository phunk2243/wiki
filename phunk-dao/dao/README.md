PHUNK DAO is composed of decentralized group (9/9) of people from phunks community, it's goal is to build and support a healthy environment for phunk community to grow in true web3 spirit. PHUNKS DAO official ERC20 token is called [$PHUNKY](phunky.md) where 90% of [distribution](phunky.md) goes to Phunk holders and 10% goes to DAO treasury. Treasury is governed in decentralized matter where any $PHUNKY holder can make proposals that Phunks community can Vote on. Vote strength is weighted in $PHUNKY each holder holds at time of active proposal using [snapshot platform](https://snapshot.org/#/), DAO itself can't participate in Voting. \
If proposal passes the Vote, DAO will execute it. For example allocation of funds for new project or endeavour, if true DAO will allocate funds. For execution 7/9 signatures are needed. This is the most decentralized way known to reach consensus within community with sole purpose to grow and expand web3 culture within global NFT and Crypto community.
